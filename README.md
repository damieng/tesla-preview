This is a simple page that allows you to configure the Roadster, Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y from a simple web page.

It allows more combinations than the official site as well as discontinued models and options.

Some configurations produce invalid imagery as it uses Tesla's backend API which does not expect certain combinations to exist.
